# GroudonExtension
This is a rom patch that changes mon's sprites, stats and cries to that of Primal Groudon.

This project began as a practical joke, but I decided to commit to the bit and learn some things along the way.
Thanks goes to the NatDex Emerald & Firered Project by CyanSixFour, to the FasterFirered patch by DrMaple, 
and to the rest of my friends in the Ironmon discord that helped along the way. 
Most of all to DogRay, without whom this joke would never have started or come into fruition.

This is not meant to be particularly fun or enjoyable to play, with 383 Groudons, but I hope anyone playing can have a good laugh at
the experience and what went into it. It most likely will be a horrid experience with extremely large bst tanks and cannons in every battle.
It is meant to be played with random pokemon types, move power, pp and types, since it would otherwise be incredibly monotonous.
